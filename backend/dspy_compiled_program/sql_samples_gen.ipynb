Performance Impact: Foreign keys can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets.\\n    3.    Implementation: FOREIGN KEY constraints can be created, modified, and viewed using standard SQL commands (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE).\\n    4.    Upgrade Considerations: If upgrading from a version prior to 6.6.0, foreign keys will not be automatically enforced and must be recreated.\\n    5.    Caution Advised: Given the potential performance impacts and experimental status, use foreign keys cautiously in TiDB.\\nIn conclusion, while supported, foreign keys in TiDB are still experimental and may have significant performance implications.\\n', 'sample': SQLSample(no_reasonable_example=False, steps=[Step(explanation=\"Create a 'users' table which will be referenced by the 'orders' table via a foreign key.\", sql='CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sample_db.users (user_id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255));'), Step(explanation=\"Create an 'orders' table with a FOREIGN KEY referencing the 'user_id' column in the 'users' table.
