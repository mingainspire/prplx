"User question: Does TiDB support FOREIGN KEY?
Answer: Yes, TiDB supports FOREIGN KEY constraints starting from version 6.6.0 as an experimental feature. However, there are key considerations:
    1.    Experimental Status: The feature is experimental and may change or be removed in future releases.
    2.    Performance Impact: Foreign keys can lead to performance issues, especially with large datasets.
    3.    Implementation: FOREIGN KEY constraints can be created, modified, and viewed using standard SQL commands (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE).
    4.    Upgrade Considerations: If upgrading from a version prior to 6.6.0, foreign keys will not be automatically enforced and must be recreated.
    5.    Caution Advised: Given the potential performance impacts and experimental status, use foreign keys cautiously in TiDB.
In conclusion, while supported, foreign keys in TiDB are still experimental and may have significant performance implications.

"User question: How to implement rolling upgrade in TiDB?
Answer: 1.    Preparation:
  - Verify no ongoing DDL operations and ensure the cluster meets the minimum topology requirements.
  - Stop the Drainer service if using TiDB Binlog.
2.    Use TiUP for Upgrade:
  - Run tiup cluster upgrade <cluster-name> <version>, following the upgrade order: PD, TiProxy (if applicable), TiFlash, TiKV, TiDB, and TiCDC.
3.    Upgrade Process:
  - TiUP upgrades nodes one by one, handling leader transfers automatically to minimize impact.
  - If any issues are detected, the process halts for manual intervention.
