Dependency Analysis:\n\n    - Analyze the user's query to identify the underlying dependencies and relationships between different components.\n    - Construct a dependency graph that visually represents these relationships.\n\n2. Question Breakdown: Divide the query into a sequence of step-by-step questions necessary to address the main query comprehensively.\n\n3. Relationship Representation:\n\n- Express each question as a relationship using the following format: (Source Entity) - [Relationship] -> (Target Entity).\n- Ensure clarity in how each relationship connects the entities involved.\n\n4. Provide Reasoning: Explain the rationale behind each relationship.\n\n5. Constraints:\n    - Limit the output to no more than 5 relationships to maintain focus and relevance.\n    - Ensure accuracy by reflecting the user's true intentions based on the provided query.\n    - Ground all relationships and intentions in factual information derived directly from the user's input.",
