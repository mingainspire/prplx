| LLM              | The LLM used during building vector index and knowledge graph index.                 | Yes      | No        |
| Embedding Model  | the embedding model used by vector index and knowledge graph index.                  | Yes      | No        |
| Indexing Methods | Vector index is forced to be enabled. The knowledge graph index is used by GraphRAG. | Yes      | No        |

### Documents Management

AutoFlow support to view and delete documents uploaded through data source. The default page of knowledge base shows it's documents.

#### Delete Documents

<Callout>
  **This operation cannot be undone**.

  Deleting documents will trigger **asynchornize** deletion process related `indexes` and `sub knowledge graphs`.
</Callout>

Scroll horizontally to the end of the documents table, click the `...` button and click the `Delete` item on the dropdown menu.

### Data Source Management

Each Knowledge Base could contain multiple data sources. You can click the `Data Sources` tab to view all data sources.

AutoFlow support three types of data sources currently:
- File uploads: Markdown (\*.md), PDF (\*.pdf), Microsoft Word (\*.docx), Microsoft PowerPoint (\*.pptx), Microsoft Excel (\*.xlsx) and Text (\*.txt) files.
- Website pages by sitemap
- Certain web wages

#### Create Data Source

You can click the button on top of data sources list to create new data sources.

#### Update Data source

You can rename data source by click the `Configure` button of data source.

#### Delete Data source

<Callout>
  **This operation cannot be undone**.

  Deleting data sources will trigger **asynchornize** deletion process related **documents**, **chunks of vector index**
  and **entities and relationships of knowledge
  graph index**.
</Callout>

You can delete data source by click the `Delete` button of data source.
