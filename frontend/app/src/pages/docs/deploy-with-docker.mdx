# Deploy with Docker Compose

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

This document provides instructions for deploying the entire Autoflow application using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Set up a [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-cloud-quickstart).  

- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

> **Note:**
> TiDB Vector Search is only available for TiDB Self-Managed (TiDB >= v8.4) and [TiDB Cloud Serverless](https://ai.pingcap.com/) for now.

## Deploy

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pingcap/autoflow.git;
    cd autoflow/;
    ```

2. Copy and edit the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    vim .env # or use another text editor to edit this file
    ```

    Replace the following placeholders with your own values:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: you can generate a random secret key using `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
    - `TIDB_HOST`, `TIDB_USER`, `TIDB_PASSWORD` and `TIDB_DATABASE`: get them from your [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://tidbcloud.com/)
      - Note: TiDB Serverless will provide a default database name called `test`, if you want to use another database name, you need to create a new database in the TiDB Serverless console.
      - Note: Don't use '#' in the password, it will cause an error when connecting to the database. See [issue](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8061).
    - `EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS`: set them according to the embedding model you choose before, it can not be changed after the deployment.

3. Migrate the database schema:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "alembic upgrade head"
    ```

4. Bootstrap the database with initial data:

    ```bash
    # Use default admin credentials (admin@example.com with random password)
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py"

    # Or specify a custom admin email
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py --email new-admin@example.com"
    ```

    Running the bootstrap script creates an admin user. You can find the username and password in the output.

    ```bash
    # Reset admin password (random generated)
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py -r"

    # Or specify a new password
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py -r --password <new_password>"
    ```

5. Start the services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    To use the local embedding model, start with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker compose --profile local-embedding-reranker up
    ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the web interface.

That's it! You can now use pingcap/autoflow locally. You can also go to https://tidb.ai to experience the live demo.


## Configuration

After you deploy the application, you need to initialize the application by following [quick start guide](./quick-start.mdx).

1. Set up the default [LLM model](./llm.mdx) in the **Models > LLMs** page.

2. Set up the default [Embedding model](./embedding-model.mdx) in the **Models > Embedding Models** page.

3. Add a new [Knowledge Base](./knowledge-base.mdx) in the **Knowledge Bases** page.

4. Configure default [Chat Engine](./chat-engine.mdx) and set up the new knowledge base as the retrieval database.

## Upgrade

This section will help you upgrade pingcap/autoflow to the new version.

Suppose you want to upgrade pingcap/autoflow from 0.1.0 to version 0.2.0

1. Edit your docker-compose.yml file to use the new image version.

    ```yaml
    services:
      backend:
        image: tidbai/backend:0.2.0
      frontend:
        image: tidbai/frontend:0.2.0
      background:
        image: tidbai/backend:0.2.0
    ```

2. Pull the new image:

    ```bash
    docker compose pull
    ```

3. Migrate the database schema:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "alembic upgrade head"
    ```

4. Recreate the docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --force-recreate
    ```

5. Check the logs to ensure everything is working correctly:

    ```bash
    docker compose logs -f
    ```

6. Done!
