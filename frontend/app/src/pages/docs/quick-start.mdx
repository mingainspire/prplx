# Quick Start

Here is a documentation page that shows how to setup a same tool like https://tidb.ai from deployment to usage. 

## Step 1: Deployment

As this tool is open source, you can deploy it on your own server. We provide a guide to deploy the entire RAG using Docker Compose.

[Read the deployment guide](./deploy-with-docker)


## Step 2: Configure

After deployment, you need to configure the tool to use your own settings.

### Configure the LLM - Large Language Model

The LLM is used for extracting knowledge from docs and generating responses. You can change the default LLM to another one.

[Configure  LLM](./llm)

### Configure the Embedding Model

The Embedding Model is a machine learning model that is trained to generate embeddings for a given input. We must translate text to vectors with this model before insert vector to database.

[Configure  Embedding Service](./embedding-model)

![Set up Embedding model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d78b771-d759-481c-a2ef-92333281ff1e)

### Configure the Reranker [Optional]

The Reranker is a machine learning model that is trained to rerank the results retrieved from the database. We use this model to improve performance of answers.

[Configure Reranker](./reranker-model)

> Note: Reranker is used to improve the performance of the answers. If you don't have a reranker model, you can skip this step.
> But we recommend you to use a reranker model to improve the performance of the answers.


## Step 3: Add a New Knowledge Base

After deployment and configuration, you need to add data source to the tool for example your own docs, knowledge base, etc.

![Add Knowledge Base](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f78be4ac-0211-48bf-9706-bb36240414cd)


> After adding data source, there will be a period of time for the tool to index the data. During this time, the tool will not be able to provide answers to users.

## Step 4: Set up the Chat Engine



## Step 5: Usage

After deployment, configuration and adding data source, you can use the tool to chat with users to answer their questions.

pingcap/autoflow provides several features to help you chat with users:

1. Out-of-the-box chat interface, e.g. https://tidb.ai
2. API to chat with users programmatically, e.g. https://tidb.ai/api-docs
3. Embeddable chat widget to integrate with your website
