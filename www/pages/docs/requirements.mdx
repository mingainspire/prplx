# Deployment Requirements
In this section, we will cover the requirements for deploying the project.


## Software Requirements
* Python 3.11 or higher.
* Node.js 18.17 or higher.
* An [TiDB Serverless Vector](https://pingcap.com/ai) account.
  * Currently only TiDB Serverless tier has the support for the Vector Search. You can use the free tier with 25GiB storage. We suggest to choose a nearby region to reduce the latency.
  * TiDB will probably introduce the Vector Search feature to the open source version next quarter, so stay tuned.


## GenAI Services / API Keys

* An **OpenAI API key**, you can get it from [here](https://platform.openai.com/). It will be used for these purposes:
  * LLM(Large Language Model) for knowledge graph extraction and chat engine.
  * Embedding model for converting text into vectors.
  * Chat Engine for generating the answer for the question asked by the user.

* An **Jina AI API key**, you can get it from [here](https://jina.ai/reranker/), it is free for 1M tokens. It will be used for reranking the results retrieved from vector storage.


## Web Hosting

### Hardware
You can use any of the following web hosting services to deploy the project:
* Cloud server providers like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), etc.
* Or your own server.

We suggest the following configuration for the server:

| Name                 | Value            |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Memory               | 8 GB RAM         |
| CPU                  | 4 vCPUs          |
| Disk                 | 100 GB SSD       |
| Number of servers    | 1                |

100 GB SSD is enough for most of the cases, but if your corpus is large then you may need more storage.

### Domain name
You need to have a domain name to deploy the project on the server. You can get a domain name from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), etc.

### SSL certificate
You need to have a domain name and SSL certificate to deploy the project on the server. You can get a free SSL certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
